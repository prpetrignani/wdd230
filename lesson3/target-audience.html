                Mark and Hannah own a traveling business that manages some apartments and offer tourist packages in the main city in the US and Europe.
                Mark got graduated in Business Management from BYU College many years ago.
                While finishing his college path, met Hannah who was working part-time in a travel agency while finishing her studies in languages.
                Now, they are willing to expand their business in Italy. They already traveled with their family in this country and fell in love with Verona, but they know nothing about Italy's laws on tourism and housing and are searching for someone who can help them with that or even create a partnership.
                Mark like to work with his laptop and do almost everything with it, while Hannah loves her tablet and she uses it to answer email, fills her spreadsheet, and makes presentations for their business.
