Zoe
Zoe is a 25-year-old  student of anthropology at Yale College.
She loves to travel around the world to discover and learn more about the local culture, customs, and traditions.
She is also very good with language and she always trying to learn something new.
After having heard from some friends and founded more than one blog talking about studying abroad, she decided to come to Europe for a semester.
A family friend that has some business in Italy advised her to check the Verona Chamber of Commerce website because it could help her with many advice.

Mark & Hannah
Mark and Hannah own a traveling business that manages some apartments and offer tourist packages in the main city in the US and Europe.
Mark got graduated in Business Management from BYU College many years ago.
While finishing his college path, met Hannah who was working part-time in a travel agency while finishing her studies in languages.
Now, they are willing to expand their business in Italy. They already traveled with their family in this country and fell in love with Verona, but they know nothing about Italy's laws on tourism and housing and are searching for someone who can help them with that or even create a partnership.
